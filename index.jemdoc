== About me

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Imperial College London, working with Professor [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/information-processing-and-communications-lab/people/deniz/ Deniz Gündüz] on the project \[Machine Learning and Information Theory\].

I received my Ph.D. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Professor [https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ctli Cheuk Ting Li] and Professor [https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/raymond.shtml Raymond W. Yeung]. 

I was a visiting scholar in [https://isl.stanford.edu Stanford University, ISL Lab], from January 2024 to June 2024, hosted by Professor [https://web.stanford.edu/~aozgur/ Ayfer Özgür] and supported by [https://www.oal.cuhk.edu.hk/phd-impac-award/ CUHK PhD IMPAC Award 2023–24]. 

I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering and minor degree in Philosophy from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) in 2021, advised by Professor [https://shhyang.github.io Shenghao Yang]. 


== Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of information theory, machine learning, and privacy.
I develop novel techniques for non-asymptotic information theory and one-shot achievability results, and I also apply these techniques in various fields of artificial intelligence, including distributed machine learning, sampling problems, LLM inference, LLM watermarking, and generalization performance characterization of learning algorithms.
In addition, I study several problems related to wireless communication and networking. 
I am always passionate about any form of collaboration and am happy to help or learn new things, so please feel free to contact me.
