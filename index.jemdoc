== About me

Before I join The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering and minor degree in Philosophy from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) in 2021. 
From January 2024 to June 2024, I visited Stanford University, [https://isl.stanford.edu ISL Lab], hosted by Professor [https://web.stanford.edu/~aozgur/ Ayfer Özgür] and supported by [https://www.oal.cuhk.edu.hk/phd-impac-award/ CUHK PhD IMPAC Award 2023–24]. I will graduate in summer 2025 and {{<font color="Red">I am looking for postdoc positions.</font>}}

== Research
Advisors: Professor [https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ctli Cheuk Ting Li] and Professor [https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/raymond.shtml Raymond W. Yeung]

My research interests lie in network information theory and applications. With more details, I currently work on the following directons:

=== One-shot/Nonasymptotic Network Information Theory: 

I prove one-shot achievability results, second-order results and asymptotic inner/outer bounds on classical network information theory problems. Currently, my primary focus is on lossy compression, channel simulation and interference channels. 

My papers on this direction include: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06021 \[Noisy Network Coding\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10806963 \[Information Hiding\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Oblivious Relaying\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10534819 \[Weighted Parity-Check Codes\]] and [papers/preprint_polar.pdf \[Soft Polar Codes\]]. 


=== Distributed Learning, Privacy and Security:

I am interested in the theoretical understanding of machine learning problems through the application of information theory techniques. I am currently employing channel simulation techniques to distributed machine learning, differential privacy and generalization error bounds.

My papers on this direction include: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20782 \[Compression of DP Mechanisms\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Information Bottleneck\]] and [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10806963 \[Information Hiding\]].


=== Wireless Communications:

I develop fundamental theory and low-complexity algorithms for large-scale networks in challenging environments. I also provide information-theoretic bounds on various multi-hop network settings, including noisy network coding, oblivious relaying and massive random access, and optimization frameworks over them. 

My papers on this direction include: [papers/preprint_scheNC.pdf \[Multiflow Optimization\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06021 \[Noisy Network Coding\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Oblivious Relaying\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10206684 \[Massive Random Access\]] and  Wireless Scheduling [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9488895 \[a\]],  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10285541 \[b\]],  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9834878 \[c\]].
