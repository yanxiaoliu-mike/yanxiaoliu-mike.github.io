== About me

Before I join The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering and minor degree in Philosophy from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) in 2021. 
From January 2024 to June 2024, I visited Stanford University, [https://isl.stanford.edu ISL Lab], hosted by Professor [https://web.stanford.edu/~aozgur/ Ayfer Özgür] and supported by [https://www.oal.cuhk.edu.hk/phd-impac-award/ CUHK PhD IMPAC Award 2023–24]. 

== Research
Advisors: Professor [https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ctli Cheuk Ting Li] and Professor [https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/raymond.shtml Raymond W. Yeung]

My research interests lie in information theory and applications. I currently work on the following directons (also see my [https://yanxiaoliu-mike.github.io/publication.html \[Publication Page\]]):

=== Information Theory: 

I provide nonasymptotic coding schemes and information-theoretic analyses on various network information theory problems. 

See my papers: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06021 \[Noisy Network Coding\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10806963 \[Watermarking\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Oblivious Relaying\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10534819 \[Weighted Parity-Check Codes\]] and [preprints/preprint_polar.pdf \[Soft Polar Codes\]]. 


=== Compression, Privacy and Distributed Learning:

I employ information-theoretic compression techniques on distributed machine learning, security and privacy problems. 

See my papers: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20782 \[Compression of DP Mechanisms\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Information Bottleneck\]] and [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10806963 \[Watermarking\]].


=== Wireless Communications:

I develop fundamental theory and low-complexity algorithms for large-scale networks in next-generation mobile networks. 

See my papers: [preprints/preprint_scheNC.pdf \[Multiflow Optimization\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06021 \[Noisy Network Coding\]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13582 \[Oblivious Relaying\]], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10206684 \[Massive Random Access\]] and  Wireless Scheduling [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9488895 \[a\]],  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10285541 \[b\]],  [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9834878 \[c\]].
