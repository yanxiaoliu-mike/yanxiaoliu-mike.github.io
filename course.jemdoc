= Teaching

I have served as a teaching assistant for 9 courses, 8 of which were unique, including 2 at the graduate level. My areas of assistance spanned information theory, optimization, probability theory, statistics, mathematics, discrete structures, electronic circuits, and practical computer network laboratories. I prepare materials, give weekly tutorials, hold weekly office hours, and grade homework and exams.
