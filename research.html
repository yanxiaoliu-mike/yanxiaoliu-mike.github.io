      <p> we introduce a new class of codes, called weighted parity-check codes, where each parity-check bit has a weight
        that indicates its likelihood to be one (instead of fixing each parity-check bit to be zero). It is applicable to a wide range of settings,
        e.g. asymmetric channels, channels with state and/or cost constraints, and the Wyner-Ziv problem, and can provably achieve the
        capacity. For the channel with state (Gelfand-Pinsker) setting, the proposed coding scheme has two advantages compared to the
        nested linear code. First, it achieves the capacity of any channel with state with binary input (e.g. asymmetric channels). Second,
        simulation results show that the proposed code achieves a smaller error rate compared to the nested linear code.  </div>

      <p> We study wireless networks with large signal propagation delays, where the network model is time-slotted.
        We exploit the topology of a periodic graph and characterize the
        inner and outer bounds of rate regions by link scheduling, where
        it is known that exactly calculating the rate regions is NP hard
        and also hard to approximate.
        We discuss two examples based on our bounds. One is a
        line network of arbitrary length, whose rate region can be
        characterized by our tight bounds. Another is K-pair network of
        arbitrary size, where our bound is also tight on the rate vector
        achieving the maximum sum rate. We show our bounds
        recover the sum rate upper bound of single collision domain
        networks.  </div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </p></div><br>

        <p> BATched Sparse code(BATS) is proposed for communication through multi-hop networks with packet loss. Based on advanced network coding techniques, BATS Protocol is proposed to meet the on-going
          and up-coming data communication demands of various network applications, including IoT, underwater networks, sensor networks and vehicular networks. Such network communications are
          characterized by large-scale, multi-hop wireless networks, where the existing network communication protocols, like TCP/IP, cannot fulfill. </p>
